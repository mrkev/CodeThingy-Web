# CodeThingy-Web

Web text editor based on [Firepad](http://www.firepad.io) using [ACE](http://ace.c9.io). This repo should remain synced with the code running at http://codethingy-mrkev.rhcloud.com/


*Note: At the moment it's really bare bones. It's just code put together in a swipe test/use along [CodeThingy](https://github.com/mrkev/CodeThingy)*
